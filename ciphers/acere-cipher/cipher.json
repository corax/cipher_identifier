Since there are not enough notes, usually the eighth notes \u266a (quavers) are used for the first letters and then the demi notes \u25cf for the last letters. Example: A = R\u00e9, B = Mi, ..., G = Do, H = R\u00e9, ..., M = Si, N = Do, ... etc. Some variants allow to code digits starting from 0 = R\u00e9 = D.",
