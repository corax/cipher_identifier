#### How to write babylonian numbers?
In mesopotamian/babylonian number system, numbers have to be converted to base 60. Numbers are written in a cuneiform style with | and . Each vertical bar | (pipe) equals a unit and each  (corner wedge or bracket) equals a tenth. The change of power of sixty (60 ^ 1 = 60, 60 ^ 2 = 3600, 30 ^ 3 = 216000, etc.) is represented by a space. Example: 23 is written with 2 tenths and 3 units so  or  Example: 61 is written 1 sixtieth and 1 unit as | | or  (with a space separator) dCode uses the recent system (from the 3rd century civilization in Babylon) which introduce the writing or 0 (before the concept of zero did not exist, it was replace by an ambiguous empty space). Since Unicode 5 (2006) cuneiform symbols can be represented on compatible browsers, here is the table of characters used by dCode: 𒐕1𒐖2𒐗3𒐘4𒐙5𒐚6𒐛7𒐜8𒐝9𒌋10𒎙20𒌍30𒐏40𒐐50 NB: The double chevron character 𒎙 (20) has been forgotten in Unicode 5 (it existed as 《) and was added in Unicode 8 (2015) but may appear malformed on some operating systems.

#### How to convert babylonian numbers?
Converting is easy by counting symbols and considering it in base 60 to get numbers into classical Hindu-Arabic notation. Example:  is 2  and 3 | so $ 2 \times 10 + 3 \times 1 = 23 $ Example: | | (note the space) is 1 | and then 1 | so $ 1 \times 60 + 1 = 61 $

#### How to convert from base 10 to base 60?
TO convert a number $ n $ from base $ 10 $ to base $ b=60 $ apply the algorithm: $$ q_0=n; i=0; \mbox{ while } q_i > 0 \mbox{ do } (r_i = q_i \mbox{ mod } 60; q_{i+1}= q_i \mbox{ div } 60 ; i = i+1 ) $$ Example: $$ q_0 = 100 \\ r_0 = 100 \mbox{ mod } 60 = 40 \;\;\; q_1 = 100 \mbox{ div } 60 = 1 \\ r_1 = 1 \mbox{ mod } 60 = 1 \;\;\; q_2 = 0 \\ So \{1,0,0\}_{(10)} = \{1, 40\}_{(60)} $$
