            "answer": "In mesopotamian/babylonian number system, numbers have to be converted to base 60. Numbers are written in a cuneiform style with | and . Each vertical bar | (pipe) equals a unit and each  (corner wedge or bracket) equals a tenth. The change of power of sixty (60 ^ 1 = 60, 60 ^ 2 = 3600, 30 ^ 3 = 216000, etc.) is represented by a space. Example: 23 is written with 2 tenths and 3 units so  or  Example: 61 is written 1 sixtieth and 1 unit as | | or  (with a space separator) dCode uses the recent system (from the 3rd century civilization in Babylon) which introduce the writing or 0 (before the concept of zero did not exist, it was replace by an ambiguous empty space). Since Unicode 5 (2006) cuneiform symbols can be represented on compatible browsers, here is the table of characters used by dCode: \ud809\udc151\ud809\udc162\ud809\udc173\ud809\udc184\ud809\udc195\ud809\udc1a6\ud809\udc1b7\ud809\udc1c8\ud809\udc1d9\ud808\udf0b10\ud808\udf9920\ud808\udf0d30\ud809\udc0f40\ud809\udc1050 NB: The double chevron character \ud808\udf99 (20) has been forgotten in Unicode 5 (it existed as \u300a) and was added in Unicode 8 (2015) but may appear malformed on some operating systems.
