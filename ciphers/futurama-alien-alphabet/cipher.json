The humor of the series appears from the introduction, on a restaurant called Tasty human burgers and a building has an ad Rent a human. Also in the episode Bender gets made, on an ambulance is written Meat Truck. The main characters of the series are called Bender and Fry and the creator of the series is Matt Groening (also author of The Simpsons) ",
