There are many ways to encode letters with these 59 symbols. dCode try common combinations in an automatic way and allows you to tell your own character list. Example: Example 1 : alphabet is composed of 14 eighth notes then the first 12 quarter notes : do1 = A, re1 = B, ... si1 = G, do2 = H, until sol2 = N then quarter notes do1 = O, etc. until fa2 = Z. Example: Example 2 : alphabet is composed of the first 13 eight notes then the 13 first quarter notes.
