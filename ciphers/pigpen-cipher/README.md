### Questions

### How to encrypt using PigPen cipher?
Encryption uses 26 symbols to represent each letter of the alphabet by mono-alphabetical substitution. Digits do not have symbols. Example: DCODE is encrypted  Symbols are created using a 3x3 grid, crosses and dots. Multiple variants exist for the creation of the alphabet and each changes the association of symbols and letters.

### How to decrypt using PigPen cipher?
PigPen decryption consists in replacing each symbol by the corresponding letter. Example:  corresponds to letters D,C,O,D,E

### How to recognize PigPen ciphertext?
The ciphered message is made from symbols with right angles which sometime has a dot (1 symbol out of 2 has a dot). The message has a maximum of 26 distinct characters. The presence of pigs, pens, gate or farm are clues. The reference to Charles M. Schulz's comic book Peanuts reminds us that one of his characters is called Pigpen.

### What are the variants of the Freemason's PigPen cipher?
It exists multiple variants for associating symbols and letters. Recently a variant has been proposed in the video game Assassin's Creed. The Knight Templars cipher is very similar and has symbols very close.

### Why was Pig Pen cipher created ?
Used by the Freemasons, this encryption allowed a written correspondence relatively difficult to decipher.

### Why this cipher is named Pig Pen ?
Symbols can be assimilated to pens and dots could be interpreted as small pigs...

### When PigPen have been invented?
