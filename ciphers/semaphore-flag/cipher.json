Each letter as well as the character space is represented by a flag, the digits (1234567890) are represented by the letters from A to K. Example: DCODE is translated  There are 3 special flags:  Which allows to pass from the digits to the letters  Which allows to pass from letters to numbers  Which indicates an error or danger Example: A1 is translated  Usually, the flags are presented in the reception mode, the transmitter looks towards the receiver (a person emitting a message will have to imagine the character mirrored).
