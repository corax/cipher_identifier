As a general rule, during exuberant festivals, attempts to be heard above the general hubbub can be exasperating and, more often, completely futile. Within a week, and with a minimum of effort, it is possible to acquire a very good practice. On the floor of a crowded cocktail, people will be able to communicate their deepest thoughts and needs to most individuals, using nothing more than the flexibility of their physique and the flexibility of the rough fabric of their pants. Certainly there is no spectacle more touching than a man dressed with a serge and three square meters of waxed floor to perfect the movements adapted in harmony. After years of practice and patience, carefully orchestrated movements can transcend simple practice and approach a level close to art. But no matter what level a person want to pursue the practice of Semaphore Trousers, in everyday life, it will be a valuable aid for communication a socially adapted use for business and especially for pleasure.
