# Tic-Tac-Toe Cipher
Tool to code / decode with the Tic-Tac-Toe cipher. The Tic-Tac-Toe code is a grid cipher, using symbols from the famous game Tic-Tac-Toe (or noughts and crosses or Xs and Os)

### Questions

### How to encrypt using Tic-Tac-Toe cipher?
The Tic-Tac-Toe code uses the 3x3 grid of the game of the same name (also known as OXO grid). The grid is composed of 2 vertical lines and 2 horizontal lines delimiting 9 distinct spaces, ie. the character # (sharp) but in bigger. In this grid are written the 26 letters of the alphabet, 3 by boxes, except for the last one that it contains only 2. Example: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ Each letter is then symbolized by a symbol characterizing its location in the grid: 2 to 4 lines to indicate the position of the box and a point to indicate the position of the letter. Example: The letter A is the left letter in the upper left portion, its symbol is  Example: The letter E is the middle letter in the upper middle portion, its symbol is  Example: The letter I is the rightmost letter in the upper right portion, its symbol is

### How to decrypt Tic-Tac-Toe cipher?
Decryption can be done visually via a drawing of the grid with paper and a pencil, replacing each symbol with the corresponding letter. Example:  is translated TICTACTOE

### How to recognize a Tic-Tac-Toe ciphertext?
The symbols are very similar and must be reminiscent of the ridge grid, right angles, 2 to 4 perpendicular lines accompanied by a single point having 3 possible positions (left, center, right). The symbols look like the Pigpen cipher which is similar.
