The grid is composed of 2 vertical lines and 2 horizontal lines delimiting 9 distinct spaces, ie. the character # (sharp) but in bigger. In this grid are written the 26 letters of the alphabet, 3 by boxes, except for the last one that it contains only 2. Example: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ Each letter is then symbolized by a symbol characterizing its location in the grid: 2 to 4 lines to indicate the position of the box and a point to indicate the position of the letter. Example: The letter A is the left letter in the upper left portion, its symbol is  Example: The letter E is the middle letter in the upper middle portion, its symbol is  Example: The letter I is the rightmost letter in the upper right portion, its symbol is",
