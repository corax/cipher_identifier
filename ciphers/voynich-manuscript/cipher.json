To write a message in English like Voynich, thanks to the alphabet EVA, it is necessary to transform each letter into a symbol according to the following correspondence table: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvxyz Note the presence of only 25 letters and the absence of the W Some letters can be written with a variant (a central line)  and  are 2 symbols for the letter K. Generally the symbol with the stroke is represented as an uppercase character. ",
