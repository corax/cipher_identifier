### Questions

#### Who is the Zodiac killer?
The Zodiac is the name given to a serial killer who would be responsible for at least 7 victims in California, USA (according to the authorities/FBI because he claims 37 victims) in the 1960s and 1970s. The murderer has never been apprehended and his story has been the subject of numerous reports, documentaries and movies.

#### What are Zodiac letters?
The Zodiac sent at least 17 letters to local newspapers. These letters sometimes contained evidence of crimes and sometimes cryptograms. It is these 4 cryptograms (called Z408, Z340, Z32 and Z13 depending on their length) made up of symbols that contributed to the mysterious reputation of the killer. To date, only the first cryptogram Z408 has been resolved. The second cryptogram Z340 is still the subject of speculation, like Z13 and Z32.

#### How to encrypt a message like Zodiac cipher?
The Z408 message is a homophonic substitution: the same letter can be encrypted by several different symbols. Example: A can be encoded by  or  or  Only one cryptogram has been resolved (Z408). the other cryptograms (Z340, Z32, Z13) use common symbols (and also new ones) but as they have not been resolved, the encryption method may be different. The letters J, Q, X or Z have no known equivalent in Z408, dCode uses an arbitrary symbol (present in Z340, Z32, Z13).

#### How to decrypt Zodiac-like cipher?
The decryption based on Z408 is that of a homophonic substitution, each character / symbol is associated with a plain letter, and several symbols can be associated with the same letter. Example:  and  both match T The cryptograms Z340, Z32 or Z13 do not necessarily use the same technique and do not have the same letter-symbol correspondences. dCode can only decrypt messages based on variant Z408.

#### What is the content of Z408?
Crypto Z-408 was sent on July 31, 1969 in 3 pages and was decoded in only 20 hours by a teacher Donald Harden and his wife Bettye. The message was:  The translation start with words I like killing people because it is so much fun....

#### What is the content of Z340?
The Crypto Z-340 was sent on November 8, 1969 and despite the efforts of both amateurs and artificial intelligence tools, it has not been decoded to date. The message is:

#### What is the content of Z13?
Crypto Z-13 is dated April 20, 1970, it is the shortest, it is preceded by MY NAME IS which suggests that the killer could reveal its identity. The message is:

#### What is the content of Z32?
The crypto Z-32 was sent on June 26, 1970, it was accompanied by a map of the San Francisco Bay.  The investigators assume that this cryptogram may contains numerical geographic coordinates.
